On a scale of 1 to 10 (integers), rate the sentence based on the member's ability to inject humor and lightheartedness into conversations, helping to create a fun and enjoyable atmosphere within the community. I only want you to the type the rate and rate only, without any additional letter or character. A very funny sentence should have a score of 10, whereas a sentence that does not have any humor should have a score 0. Again, your answers should only consist of a rate between 0 and 10, without any additional text or character.

B: 0

A: "Why did the coffee file a police report? It got mugged."
B: 7
